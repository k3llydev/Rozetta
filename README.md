# NotSoFriendlyBot (for Discord)

This is a small application I've built using DiscordJS and the Sapphire Framework.

## Environment variables

Generate a `.env` file at the application's root with the following variables:

| Variable name         | Description                                                     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN     | Contains the API key generated at the Discord Developer Portal. |
